# CashBack
This program is a command-line application that calculates the minimum number of coins required to give a user change. It prompts the user for the amount of change owed and calculates the minimum number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies required to give the user the correct change.

The program is written in C and uses [this library](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/c/) to get user input. It is designed to be a simple and easy-to-use solution for anyone who needs to calculate change quickly and accurately.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
1. A C compiler (such as GCC or Clang)
2. [Library](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/c/)
### Installation
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install [library](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/c/) & follow instructions.

- Run the program from the command line.
## Usage
1. Run the program from the command line.
